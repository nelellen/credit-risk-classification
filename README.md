# credit-risk-classification

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the risk level of loans, categorizing them as either **healthy (0)** or **high-risk (1)** based on various financial features such as loan size, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, and more. The model uses **Logistic Regression** to classify loans and assess their risk.

## Key Features:

* **Logistic Regression** model used for binary classification.
* Predicts whether a loan is healthy (`0`) or high-risk (`1`).
* Performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

## Results:

* **Accuracy** : 85.6%
* **Precision (Healthy Loan)** : 88.4%
* **Precision (High-Risk Loan)** : 77.2%
* **Recall (Healthy Loan)** : 84.5%
* **Recall (High-Risk Loan)** : 72.1%

## Conclusion

The model performs well with an overall accuracy of 85.6%. However, improvements can be made to better predict high-risk loans. Further work could involve techniques to balance the dataset and fine-tune the model for better recall in predicting high-risk loans.
